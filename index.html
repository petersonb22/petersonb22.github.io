			<h2> What is Fantasy? </h2>
			<p> Fantasy is arguably the oldest genre of literature. It involves settings not based on reality,
			but instead created from the authors imagination. Most fantasy stories feature supernatural elements,
			such as magic and monsters, but it is not a requirement. When most people think fantasy, they probably
			think of books, but almost any form of media can be fantasy.
